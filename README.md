# Virtual-Keyboard-Using-Computer-Vision

## Description:
This project implements a virtual keyboard using a webcam, hand tracking, and OpenCV. Users can interact with the keyboard by moving their fingers over keys and "clicking" them using a simple hand gesture. The pressed keys are displayed on the screen.

## Features:
1.Hand tracking to identify finger movements.
2.Interactive virtual keyboard interface.
3.Real-time text input using hand gestures.
4.Displays the typed text on the screen.
5.Special keys: Space and Backspace functionality.
6.Exit the program by pressing the Esc key.

## Technologies Used:
1.Python 3.x
2.OpenCV
3.CvZone
4.Mediapipe
5.Installation Requirements:
6.Python 3.x installed on your system.
7.Required Python libraries:
8.opencv-python
9.mediapipe
10.cvzone
11.pynput


## Setup and Installation:

Clone or download this repository.

Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe cvzone pynput
Save the Python script (e.g., keyboard.py) in the project folder.

Usage Instructions:
Run the Python script:
python keyboard.py

The webcam feed will appear on the screen with a virtual keyboard overlay.
Move your index finger to hover over the keys.
Bring the index and middle finger close to "click" a key.
Typed characters will appear on the output screen.
Press Space or Backspace for their respective actions.
